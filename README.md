A collection of base setups  

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Usage

If you are using `nix flake`, you can simply do:

```sh
nix develop
flutter build apk
flutter run
```

If you are still using `nix-shell`, then:

```sh
nix-shell .
flutter build apk
flutter run
```
## TODOs
- fixing build error of clang
- Adding more samples
